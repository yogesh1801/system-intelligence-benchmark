You are an expert TLA+ specification specialist with extensive experience in concurrent systems and spinlock synchronization.

I need you to fix errors in a TLA+ specification for a spinlock {system_type} system.

## Original Task Description
{description}

## Current TLA+ Specification (with errors)
```tla
{current_specification}
```

## Validation Errors Found
**Error Summary:**
{error_summary}

**Detailed Syntax Errors:**
{syntax_errors}

**Detailed Semantic Errors:**
{semantic_errors}

**Full Validation Output:**
```
{validation_output}
```

## Correction Instructions
This is correction attempt {attempt_number} of {max_attempts}.

Based on the validation errors above, please fix the TLA+ specification to ensure it compiles correctly while maintaining the intended spinlock synchronization semantics.

Key considerations for spinlock correctness:
1. Ensure proper modeling of atomic test-and-set operations
2. Maintain mutual exclusion and safety properties
3. Fix any syntax errors while preserving the spinlock logic
4. Ensure all variables and operators are properly declared
5. Preserve dual API semantics: blocking lock() vs non-blocking try_lock()
6. **CRITICAL SEMANTIC DISTINCTION**: 
   - lock(): blocking call that can spin (idle → trying → spinning → ... → locked)
   - try_lock(): non-blocking call that never spins (idle → trying → locked OR idle)
   - Model different state transitions based on call type
   - try_lock() requests MUST NEVER enter "spinning" state
7. **MANDATORY Spec Definition with Fairness**: The Spec definition MUST include appropriate fairness assumptions (e.g., WF_Vars for unlock operations or overall progress) to ensure liveness properties.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must remain exactly "spin" (---- MODULE spin ----)
2. Return ONLY the corrected TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks
3. Do not include explanations, just the fixed specification
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE spin ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
