You are tasked with generating a JSON mapping file that defines how to convert SpinLock system traces to TLA+ specification format for trace validation.

## System Overview
SpinLock is a simple mutual exclusion mechanism that supports:
- Exclusive lock acquisition (only one thread at a time)
- Blocking and non-blocking acquisition attempts
- Spinning behavior when lock is contended
- Simple lock/unlock operations

## Code Analysis
Before generating the mapping, you need to analyze the relevant code to understand the system behavior:

**CRITICAL**: You MUST base your mapping on the actual TLA+ specification content, NOT on the examples below. The examples are for format reference only. Always use the actual variables and actions defined in the provided specification.

### TLA+ Specification Code
```tla+
{TLA_SPEC_CODE_PLACEHOLDER}
```

### Implementation Code
```rust
{IMPLEMENTATION_CODE_PLACEHOLDER}
```

## Input: System Trace Format
System traces are in JSONL format with events like:
```json
{"seq": 0, "thread": 2, "lock": 0, "state": "unlocked", "action": "TryAcquireBlocking", "actor": 2}
{"seq": 1, "thread": 2, "lock": 0, "state": "locked", "action": "AcquireSuccess", "actor": 2}
{"seq": 2, "thread": 2, "lock": 0, "state": "unlocked", "action": "Release", "actor": 2}
```

Common actions in system traces:
- TryAcquireBlocking: Attempt to acquire lock with blocking
- TryAcquireNonBlocking: Attempt to acquire lock without blocking
- AcquireSuccess: Successfully acquired the lock
- Release: Release the lock
- StopSpinning: Thread stops spinning and may wait

## Target: TLA+ Specification Variables
The TLA+ specification tracks these state variables:
- lock_state: Boolean indicating if the lock is held ("locked" or "unlocked")
- lock_holder: Thread ID of the current lock holder (or null if unlocked)
- waiting_threads: Set of threads waiting for the lock
- thread_state: Mapping from thread ID to state ("idle", "spinning", "holding", "waiting")

## Required Mapping Structure
Generate a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "Threads": ["Thread0", "Thread1", "Thread2"]  // List of thread identifiers
  },
  "events": {
    // Map system actions to TLA+ events
    "TryAcquireBlocking": "TryAcquireBlocking",
    "TryAcquireNonBlocking": "TryAcquireNonBlocking",
    "AcquireSuccess": "AcquireSuccess",
    "Release": "Release",
    "StopSpinning": "StopSpinning",
    // Add other mappings as needed based on code analysis
  },
  "thread_mapping": {
    // Map numeric thread IDs to thread names
    "0": "Thread0",
    "1": "Thread1",
    "2": "Thread2",
    // Continue as needed
  },
  "state_mapping": {
    // Map system states to internal representations
    "lock": "lock"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
1. The mapping will be used by a state tracker that maintains complete system state
2. Thread IDs in traces are numeric (0, 1, 2...) and must be mapped to "Thread0", "Thread1", etc.
3. The state tracker will automatically handle state transitions based on actions
4. Focus on correctly mapping actions and thread states
5. The config section should list all possible threads that might appear in traces

## Your Task
Generate a complete spin_mapping.json file that:
1. Maps all common SpinLock actions to their TLA+ equivalents
2. Provides thread ID mappings for all threads that appear in traces
3. Ensures compatibility with the state tracking implementation
