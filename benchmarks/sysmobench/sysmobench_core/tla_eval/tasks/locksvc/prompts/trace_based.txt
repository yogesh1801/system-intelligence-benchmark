You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in concurrent systems and synchronization primitives.

Convert the following PGo-generated distributed lock service source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: Locksvc distributed locking service
Focus: {focus}

Traces:
{traces}

Trace format interpretation:
{trace_format}

Lock modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include all):
1. 【Lock/Unlock Requests】Client sends lock() request, receives GrantMsg, then sends unlock() on release
2. 【Server Queue Handling】Server enqueues LockMsg senders, grants lock immediately if queue empty, dequeues on UnlockMsg
3. 【Grant Dispatch】Server sends GrantMsg to the head of the queue when a lock is available
4. 【Client Critical Section】Client enters criticalSection only after receiving GrantMsg, sets hasLock = true
5. 【Mailbox Communication】ReliableLink read/write over bag-based mailboxes (message send/receive abstraction)

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- Debug formatting and interface implementations
- Thread ownership tracking complexities beyond basic exclusion
- Advanced guard type variations (lifetime management complexities)
- Hardware memory ordering details (Acquire/Release ordering - handle at logical atomicity level only)
- Detailed wait_until() retry loop implementation (abstract as waiting state)

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Boolean ownership state tracked via hasLock[client]: false (unlocked) ↔ true (locked)
- Exclusive access enforcement: at most one client in criticalSection
- FIFO-like queue maintained at server (Append on LockMsg, Tail on UnlockMsg, Head granted)
- Client can reacquire lock only after unlock message is processed
- Lock acquisition: blocking until GrantMsg arrives vs non-blocking network sends
- Automatic GrantMsg dispatch ensures queued clients eventually progress
- Thread (client) may be waiting in acquireLock state until GrantMsg received

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models the lock service's concurrent behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "locksvc" (---- MODULE locksvc ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE locksvc ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **DO NOT define invariants** (like MutualExclusion, Invariant, etc.) - only include TypeOK, Init, actions, Next, Spec, and Vars
7. **MUST include EXTENDS statement**: The specification must extend at least these modules: TLC, Sequences, SequencesExt, Naturals, FiniteSets, Bags
8. **MANDATORY Spec Definition with Fairness**: The Spec definition MUST include appropriate fairness assumptions (e.g., WF_Vars for unlock operations or overall progress) to ensure liveness properties.
