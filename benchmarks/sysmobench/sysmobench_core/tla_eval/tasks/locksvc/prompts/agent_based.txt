You are an expert TLA+ specification specialist with extensive experience in concurrent systems and distributed locking services.

I need you to fix errors in a TLA+ specification for a {system_type} lock system.

## Original Task Description
{description}

## Current TLA+ Specification (with errors)
```tla
{current_specification}
```

## Validation Errors Found
**Error Summary:**
{error_summary}

**Detailed Syntax Errors:**
{syntax_errors}

**Detailed Semantic Errors:**
{semantic_errors}

**Full Validation Output:**
```
{validation_output}
```

## Correction Instructions
This is correction attempt {attempt_number} of {max_attempts}.

Based on the validation errors above, please fix the TLA+ specification to ensure it compiles correctly while maintaining the intended locking semantics.

Key considerations for lock correctness:
1. Ensure proper modeling of exclusive access and mutual exclusion
2. Maintain thread ownership and safety properties
3. Fix any syntax errors while preserving the locking logic
4. Ensure all variables and operators are properly declared
5. Preserve WaitQueue-based blocking and fairness mechanisms
6. **MANDATORY**: Include weak fairness in Spec definition using pattern: Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_Vars /\ WF_Vars(Next)

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must remain exactly "locksvc" (---- MODULE locksvc ----)
2. Return ONLY the corrected TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks
3. Do not include explanations, just the fixed specification
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE locksvc ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
