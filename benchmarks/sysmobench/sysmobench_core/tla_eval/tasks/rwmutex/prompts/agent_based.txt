You are an expert TLA+ specification specialist with extensive experience in concurrent systems and read-write mutex synchronization.

I need you to fix errors in a TLA+ specification for a read-write mutex {system_type} system.

## Original Task Description
{description}

## Current TLA+ Specification (with errors)
```tla
{current_specification}
```

## Validation Errors Found
**Error Summary:**
{error_summary}

**Detailed Syntax Errors:**
{syntax_errors}

**Detailed Semantic Errors:**
{semantic_errors}

**Full Validation Output:**
```
{validation_output}
```

## Correction Instructions
This is correction attempt {attempt_number} of {max_attempts}.

Based on the validation errors above, please fix the TLA+ specification to ensure it compiles correctly while maintaining the intended read-write mutex synchronization semantics.

Key considerations for read-write mutex correctness:
1. Ensure proper modeling of multiple readers and exclusive writer semantics
2. Maintain reader-writer safety properties (no simultaneous read-write)
3. Fix any syntax errors while preserving the rwmutex logic
4. Ensure all variables and operators are properly declared
5. Preserve WaitQueue-based coordination and upgradeable reader semantics
6. **MANDATORY**: Include weak fairness in Spec definition using pattern: Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_Vars /\ WF_Vars(Next)

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must remain exactly "rwmutex" (---- MODULE rwmutex ----)
2. Return ONLY the corrected TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks
3. Do not include explanations, just the fixed specification
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE rwmutex ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
