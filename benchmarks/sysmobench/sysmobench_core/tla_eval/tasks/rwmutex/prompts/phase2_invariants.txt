You are a TLA+ expert. Analyze the following read-write mutex TLA+ specification and generate meaningful invariants for model checking.

## Input Specification:

$tla_spec

## Requirements:

1. **Analyze the specification** to understand the read-write mutex behavior and state variables
2. **Check existing invariants** - DO NOT generate invariants with names that already exist in the specification
3. **Generate 2-3 NEW key invariants** that capture important safety properties for read-write synchronization
4. **Use proper TLA+ syntax** for each invariant definition (Name == Expression)
5. **Focus on reader-writer exclusion and concurrency properties not already covered**
6. **Output ONLY the raw invariant definitions** - no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks, no quotes

## Expected Output Format:

ReaderWriterExclusion == condition1
ReaderCounting == condition2
WriterExclusivity == condition3

**IMPORTANT: Your response must contain only valid TLA+ invariant definitions that do NOT already exist in the specification. Start immediately with the first NEW invariant definition and include nothing else. Do not wrap in quotes or code blocks.**
