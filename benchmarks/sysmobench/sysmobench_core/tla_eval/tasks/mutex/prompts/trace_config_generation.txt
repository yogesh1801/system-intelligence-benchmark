Generate a YAML configuration file from the provided TLA+ specification (.tla) and configuration (.cfg) files. Extract information according to the following rules:

## Task Description
Parse the TLA+ specification and configuration files to create a structured YAML configuration that captures the specification name, constants, variables, actions, and interactions.

## Extraction Rules

### spec_name
Extract from the module declaration line: `---- MODULE <ModuleName> ----`
The spec_name is the ModuleName between "---- MODULE" and "----".

### constants
Extract from the CONSTANTS section in the .cfg file.
- name: The constant identifier
- value: The assigned value, formatted as:
  - Sets: Wrap in single quotes, e.g., '{s1, s2, s3}' becomes '{"s1", "s2", "s3"}'
  - Strings: Wrap in single quotes with double quotes inside, e.g., Nil becomes '"Nil"'
  - Numbers: Wrap in single quotes as string, e.g., 5 becomes '5'

### variables
Extract from the Init operator definition in the .tla file.
For each variable assignment in Init:
- name: The variable name
- default_value: The initial value expression (preserve TLA+ syntax, escape backslashes)

### actions
Extract from the Next operator definition. Include only direct action calls (not numbered interactions).
For each action:
- name: The action/operator name
- parameters: List of parameters with:
  - name: Parameter variable name
  - source: Where the parameter comes from (e.g., Server, messages)
- stmt: The complete statement as it appears in Next (including any conditions)

### interactions
Extract from the Next operator definition. Include only numbered intermediate actions.
Just list the names (e.g., HandletickElection_1, HandletickHeartbeat_1)

## Example
Given this TLA+ specification:

---- MODULE SimpleSpec ----
...
Init ==
/\ x = 0
/\ y = [s \in Server |-> 0]

Next ==
\/ \E s \in Server : Action1(s)
\/ \E m \in messages : Action2(m)
\/ IntermediateAction_1

And this configuration:

CONSTANTS
Server = {s1, s2}
MaxValue = 10

Generate this YAML:

```yaml
spec_name: SimpleSpec
constants:
- name: Server
  value: '{"s1", "s2"}'
- name: MaxValue
  value: '10'
variables:
- name: x
  default_value: '0'
- name: y
  default_value: '[s \\in Server |-> 0]'
actions:
- name: Action1
  parameters:
  - name: s
    source: Server
  stmt: Action1(s)
- name: Action2
  parameters:
  - name: m
    source: messages
  stmt: Action2(m)
interactions:
- name: IntermediateAction_1
```

## Important Notes
1. Return ONLY the YAML content - no explanations, comments, or natural language
2. Preserve TLA+ syntax exactly in default_value fields (escape backslashes)
3. For actions with conditions, include the full stmt as it appears in Next
4. Ignore variables that appear in Init but are not part of the main specification (e.g., pc, info, stack)
5. Order matters: spec_name, constants, variables, actions, interactions

Generate the YAML configuration based on the provided TLA+ files:
