You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in distributed systems, particularly distributed published-consumer queues.

Convert the following etcd source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: dqueue distributed publisher-consumer queue
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```go
{source_code}
```

dqueue-specific modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include all):
1. 【Message Types】request, produce
2. 【Node States】Four states: c, c1, c2, p, p1, p2

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- MPCalContext management
- Goroutine setup and teardown
- Advanced flow control and progress tracking details

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Produce-consume Cycle: c → c1 → p → p1 → p2 → c2
- One single Producer and any number of consumers
- Simple FIFO network

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models dqueue's distributed behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "dqueue" (---- MODULE dqueue ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE dqueue ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **DO NOT define invariants** (like MutualExclusion, Invariant, etc.) - focus on modeling the system behavior
7. **MUST include EXTENDS statement**: The specification must extend at least these modules: TLC, Sequences, SequencesExt, Naturals, FiniteSets, Bags
8. **MANDATORY Spec Definition with Fairness**: The Spec definition MUST include appropriate fairness assumptions (e.g., WF_vars/SF_vars for action operations) to ensure liveness properties.
