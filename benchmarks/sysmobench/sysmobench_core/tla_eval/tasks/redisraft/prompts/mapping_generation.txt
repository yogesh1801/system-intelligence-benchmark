You are tasked with generating a JSON mapping file that defines how to convert RedisRaft system traces to TLA+ specification format for trace validation.

## System Overview
RedisRaft is a Redis module that implements the Raft consensus algorithm supporting:
- Leader election with prevote and vote phases
- Log replication across multiple nodes
- State transitions between Follower, Candidate, and Leader roles
- Message passing between nodes for consensus operations

## Code Analysis
Before generating the mapping, you need to analyze the relevant code to understand the system behavior:

**CRITICAL**: You MUST base your mapping on the actual TLA+ specification content, NOT on the examples below. The examples are for format reference only. Always use the actual variables and actions defined in the provided specification.

### TLA+ Specification Code
```tla+
{TLA_SPEC_CODE_PLACEHOLDER}
```

### Implementation Code
```c
{IMPLEMENTATION_CODE_PLACEHOLDER}
```

## Input: System Trace Format
System traces are in JSONL format with events like:
```json
{"timestamp":82244.520673,"name":"InitState","nid":2,"role":"follower","state":{"term":0,"vote":-1,"commit":0}}
{"timestamp":82245.724446,"name":"BecomePreCandidate","nid":3,"role":"precandidate","term":0,"leader":-1}
{"timestamp":82245.774296,"name":"PreVoteResponse","nid":1,"vote_granted":1,"term":0,"prevote":1}
{"timestamp":82246.125599,"name":"RequestVote","nid":3,"msg":{"type":"MsgVote","from":3,"to":1,"term":1,"candidate_id":3,"last_log_idx":0,"last_log_term":0}}
```

Common actions in system traces:
- InitState: Node initialization
- BecomePreCandidate: Start prevote phase
- BecomeCandidate: Transition to candidate role
- BecomeFollower: Transition to follower role
- BecomeLeader: Transition to leader role
- RequestVote: Send vote request to other nodes
- PreVoteResponse: Response to prevote request
- VoteResponse: Response to vote request
- ReceivedPreVoteResponse: Received prevote response
- ReceivedVoteResponse: Received vote response
- PersistState: Persist current state
- AppendEntries: Send log entries to followers

## Target: TLA+ Specification Variables
The TLA+ specification tracks these state variables:
- currentTerm: Current term number for each node
- state: Node role (Follower, Candidate, Leader)
- votedFor: Which candidate this node voted for in current term
- commitIndex: Index of highest log entry known to be committed
- log: Log entries for each node
- messages: In-flight messages between nodes

## Required Mapping Structure
Generate a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "Servers": ["n1", "n2", "n3"],
    "MaxTerm": 10,
    "MaxLogLen": 100,
    "Nil": "Nil",
    "Values": [1, 2, 3]
  },
  "events": {
    "InitState": "Init",
    "BecomePreCandidate": "BecomeCandidate",
    "BecomeCandidate": "BecomeCandidate",
    "BecomeFollower": "BecomeFollower",
    "BecomeLeader": "BecomeLeader",
    "RequestVote": "RequestVote",
    "PreVoteResponse": "HandlePreVoteResponse",
    "VoteResponse": "HandleVoteResponse",
    "ReceivedPreVoteResponse": "ReceiveVoteResponse",
    "ReceivedVoteResponse": "ReceiveVoteResponse",
    "PersistState": "PersistState",
    "AppendEntries": "AppendEntries"
  },
  "variables": {
    "currentTerm": {
      "system_path": ["state", "term"],
      "tla_variable": "currentTerm",
      "type": "function",
      "default_value": 0
    },
    "state": {
      "system_path": ["role"],
      "tla_variable": "state",
      "type": "function",
      "value_mapping": {
        "follower": "Follower",
        "precandidate": "Candidate",
        "candidate": "Candidate",
        "leader": "Leader"
      },
      "default_value": "Follower"
    },
    "votedFor": {
      "system_path": ["state", "vote"],
      "tla_variable": "votedFor",
      "type": "function",
      "value_mapping": {
        "-1": "Nil",
        "0": "Nil"
      },
      "default_value": "Nil"
    },
    "commitIndex": {
      "system_path": ["state", "commit"],
      "tla_variable": "commitIndex",
      "type": "function",
      "default_value": 0
    },
    "log": {
      "system_path": ["log"],
      "tla_variable": "log",
      "type": "function",
      "default_value": "<<>>"
    }
  },
  "node_mapping": {
    "1": "n1",
    "2": "n2",
    "3": "n3"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
1. The mapping will be used by a state tracker that maintains complete system state
2. Node IDs in traces are numeric (1, 2, 3...) and must be mapped to "n1", "n2", etc.
3. The state tracker will automatically handle state transitions based on actions
4. Focus on correctly mapping actions and node states
5. The config section should list all possible nodes that might appear in traces
6. Extract values using "system_path" from RedisRaft trace events
7. Provide appropriate default values and value mappings
8. The "type" field indicates how the variable is used in TLA+ (function, bag, scalar)

## Your Task
Generate a complete redisraft_mapping.json file that:
1. Maps all common RedisRaft Raft actions to their TLA+ equivalents
2. Maps all TLA+ state variables to trace extraction paths
3. Provides node ID mappings for all nodes that appear in traces
4. Ensures compatibility with the state tracking implementation
5. Uses EXACT variable and action names from the TLA+ specification
