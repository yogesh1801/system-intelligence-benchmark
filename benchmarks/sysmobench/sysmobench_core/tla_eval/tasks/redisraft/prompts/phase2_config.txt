You are a TLA+ expert. Generate a complete TLC configuration file (.cfg) for the RedisRaft specification that can be directly saved and used for model checking.

## Input Specification:

$tla_spec

## Generated Invariants:

$invariants

## Requirements:

1. **Analyze the specification** to identify the main specification name and all declared constants
2. **Generate complete .cfg file content** with SPECIFICATION, CONSTANTS, and INVARIANT sections
3. **Use small values for constants** to ensure efficient model checking for complete Raft protocol:
   - Servers: Small set like {1, 2, 3} for 3-server cluster
   - Nil: Constant for undefined values
4. **Include ALL provided invariants** in the INVARIANT section
5. **Output ONLY the raw .cfg file content** - no explanations, no markdown, no code blocks

## Example Output Format:

SPECIFICATION SpecName

CONSTANTS
    Server = {1, 2, 3}
    Nil = "Nil"
    ...

INVARIANT
    TypeOK
    ElectionSafety
    LogMatching
    ...

**CRITICAL: Your response must contain exactly ONE complete .cfg file. Do not repeat any sections. Start your response immediately with "SPECIFICATION" and include nothing else. Each invariant name must be on its own line. Stop immediately after the last invariant name with no additional text.**
