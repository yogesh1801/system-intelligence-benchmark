You are an expert TLA+ specification specialist with extensive experience in distributed systems modeling.

I need you to fix errors in a TLA+ specification for a Raft-based {system_type} system.

## Original Task Description
{description}

## Current TLA+ Specification (with errors)
```tla
{current_specification}
```

## Validation Errors Found
**Error Summary:**
{error_summary}

**Detailed Syntax Errors:**
{syntax_errors}

**Detailed Semantic Errors:**
{semantic_errors}

**Full Validation Output:**
```
{validation_output}
```

## Correction Instructions
This is correction attempt {attempt_number} of {max_attempts}.

Please provide a corrected TLA+ specification that fixes these errors. Your corrected specification should:

1. **Fix all syntax errors**: Ensure proper TLA+ syntax, correct operator usage, and valid module structure
2. **Resolve semantic errors**: Define missing variables, operators, and ensure logical consistency
3. **Maintain original intent**: Keep the core distributed system logic and behavior from the source code
4. **Follow TLA+ best practices**: Use appropriate data structures, actions, and invariants
5. **Be complete and self-contained**: Include all necessary EXTENDS, CONSTANTS, VARIABLES, and operator definitions

Focus specifically on:
- Defining any missing variables or constants
- Implementing missing operators or functions
- Fixing syntax issues with operators, expressions, or module structure
- Ensuring proper action definitions and state transitions
- Maintaining consistency with Raft's distributed consensus behavior

**CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code
- NO markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)  
- NO explanations, comments, or text outside the specification
- NO formatting markers of any kind
- The MODULE name must be exactly "redisraft"
- Start directly with: ---- MODULE redisraft ----
