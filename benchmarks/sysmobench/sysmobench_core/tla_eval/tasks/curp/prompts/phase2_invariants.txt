You are an expert in distributed consensus protocols and formal verification, with particular expertise in the CURP consensus algorithm and TLA+ specifications.

## Task
Define invariants for the CURP consensus protocol specification that capture its essential safety and consistency properties.

## CURP Protocol Context
CURP (Consensus with Unreplicated Proposed commands) is a consensus protocol with:
- **Speculative Execution**: Commands can execute before full consensus
- **Enhanced Availability**: Uses super_quorum for improved availability
- **Multiple Quorum Types**: standard quorum, recover_quorum, and super_quorum
- **Reduced Latency**: Through speculative command execution
- **Abstracted Raft**: Simple leader changes instead of complex Raft details

## Current Specification
```tla
{current_specification}
```

## Invariant Requirements

Please provide invariants that verify:

1. **Consensus Safety**:
   - Commands committed by any node are eventually committed by all nodes
   - No conflicting decisions on the same command
   - Command ordering consistency

2. **CURP-Specific Properties**:
   - Speculative execution correctness
   - Super quorum availability guarantees
   - Recover quorum recovery properties
   - Command speculation and commitment relationship

3. **Basic Distributed System Properties**:
   - Node state consistency
   - Message ordering properties
   - Leadership properties (if applicable)

4. **Protocol Integrity**:
   - Well-formed protocol states
   - Valid transitions between protocol phases
   - Proper quorum calculations

## Output Format
Provide invariants as TLA+ expressions that can be added to the specification for model checking. Include:
- Clear invariant names
- Precise TLA+ formulations
- Brief comments explaining what each invariant checks

**Return only the invariant definitions** - no explanations outside of comments in the TLA+ code.
