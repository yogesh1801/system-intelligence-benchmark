You are an expert in formal verification and TLA+ specifications with deep expertise in distributed systems, particularly etcd and Raft consensus.

Convert the following etcd source code to a comprehensive TLA+ specification.

System: etcd distributed key-value store
Focus: {focus}

Source Code from {file_path}:
```go
{source_code}
```

etcd-specific modeling requirements:

MANDATORY CORE ACTIONS (must include all):
1. 【Message Types】MsgHup (election timeout), MsgVote/MsgVoteResp (voting), MsgApp/MsgAppResp (log replication)  
2. 【Node States】Four states: StateFollower, StateCandidate, StateLeader, StatePreCandidate (prevote enabled)
3. 【Leader Election】Complete prevote + vote phases: PreCandidate → Candidate → Leader transitions
4. 【Log Operations】Log entry appending, consistency checks, commitment with majority quorum
5. 【Heartbeat/Timeout】Election timeouts triggering campaigns, heartbeat prevention of elections
6. 【Client Proposals】MsgProp message handling and log entry creation by leaders

EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED (do not model):
- Configuration changes and joint consensus (ConfChange messages)  
- Log compaction and snapshots (MsgSnap)
- ReadIndex optimizations (MsgReadIndex) 
- Async storage operations (LocalAppendThread, LocalApplyThread)
- Advanced flow control and progress tracking details

REQUIRED BEHAVIORAL SCOPE:
- Prevote phase (StatePreCandidate) must be modeled as it's enabled by default in etcd
- State transition constraints: Follower → PreCandidate → Candidate → Leader (strict transitions)
- Message processing by state: only valid message types handled in each node state
- Term advancement rules: nodes advance term when receiving messages with higher term
- Voting restrictions: one vote per term, term must be current or newer
- Heartbeat mechanism: leaders send heartbeats, followers reset election timeout on receipt
- Log consistency checks: prevLogIndex/prevLogTerm validation in MsgApp processing
- Majority-based leader election and log commitment
- Basic network message delays and losses

Generate a TLA+ specification that accurately models etcd's distributed behavior.

CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. The MODULE name must be exactly "etcdraft" (---- MODULE etcdraft ----)
2. Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```)
3. Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers
4. Start your response directly with: ---- MODULE etcdraft ----
5. End your response with the closing ====
6. **DO NOT define invariants** (like MutualExclusion, Invariant, etc.) - focus on modeling the system behavior
7. **MANDATORY Spec Definition with Fairness**: The Spec definition MUST include appropriate fairness assumptions (e.g., WF_vars/SF_vars for action operations) to ensure liveness properties.
