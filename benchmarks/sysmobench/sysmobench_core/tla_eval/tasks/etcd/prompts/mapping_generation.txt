You are tasked with generating a JSON mapping file that defines how to convert etcd Raft system traces to TLA+ specification format for trace validation.

## System Overview
etcd Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm implementation that supports:
- Leader election with terms and prevoting/voting
- Log replication across multiple nodes
- State transitions between Follower, Candidate, and Leader roles
- Message passing between nodes

## Code Analysis
Before generating the mapping, you need to analyze the relevant code to understand the system behavior:

**CRITICAL**: You MUST base your mapping on the actual TLA+ specification content, NOT on the examples below. The examples are for format reference only. Always use the actual variables and actions defined in the provided specification.

### TLA+ Specification Code
```tla+
{TLA_SPEC_CODE_PLACEHOLDER}
```

### Implementation Code
```go
{IMPLEMENTATION_CODE_PLACEHOLDER}
```

## Input: System Trace Format
System traces are in JSONL format with events like:
```json
{"conf":[["1","2","3"],[]],"log":0,"name":"InitState","nid":"1","role":"StateFollower","state":{"commit":0,"term":0,"vote":"0"}}
{"conf":[["1","2","3"],[]],"log":1,"name":"BecomeCandidate","nid":"1","role":"StateCandidate","state":{"commit":0,"term":1,"vote":"0"}}
{"conf":[["1","2","3"],[]],"log":1,"name":"BecomeCandidate","nid":"2","role":"StateCandidate","state":{"commit":0,"term":1,"vote":"0"}}
```

Common actions in system traces:
- BecomeFollower: Transition to follower role
- BecomeCandidate: Transition to candidate role
- BecomeLeader: Transition to leader role
- Ready: Node is ready for operations
- PreVote/Vote: Cast prevote/vote during election
- AppendEntries: Replicate log entries
- Heartbeat: Send/receive heartbeat messages

## Target: TLA+ Specification Variables
The TLA+ specification tracks these state variables:
- currentTerm: Current term number for each node
- state: Node role (Follower, Candidate, Leader)
- votedFor: Which candidate this node voted for in current term
- commitIndex: Index of highest log entry known to be committed
- nextIndex: For leaders, next log entry to send to each server
- matchIndex: For leaders, highest log entry known to be replicated on server

## Required Mapping Structure
Generate a JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "Server": ["Server1", "Server2", "Server3"]  // List of node identifiers
  },
  "events": {
    // Map system actions to TLA+ events
    "InitState": "Init",
    "BecomeFollower": "BecomeFollower",
    "BecomeCandidate": "BecomeCandidate",
    "BecomeLeader": "BecomeLeader",
    "Ready": "Ready",
    "Vote": "Vote",
    "AppendEntries": "AppendEntries",
    "Heartbeat": "Heartbeat",
    // Add other mappings as needed based on code analysis
  },
  "node_mapping": {
    // Map string node IDs to node names
    "1": "Node1",
    "2": "Node2",
    "3": "Node3",
    // Continue as needed
  },
  "role_mapping": {
    // Map system roles to TLA+ states
    "StateFollower": "Follower",
    "StateCandidate": "Candidate",
    "StateLeader": "Leader"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Notes
1. The mapping will be used by a state tracker that maintains complete system state
2. Server IDs in traces are numeric (0, 1, 2...) and must be mapped to "Server1", "Server2", etc.
3. The state tracker will automatically handle state transitions based on actions
4. Focus on correctly mapping actions and Server states
5. The config section should list all possible Server that might appear in traces

## Your Task
Generate a complete etcd_mapping.json file that:
1. Maps all common etcd Raft actions to their TLA+ equivalents
2. Provides server ID mappings for all servers that appear in traces
3. Ensures compatibility with the state tracking implementation
