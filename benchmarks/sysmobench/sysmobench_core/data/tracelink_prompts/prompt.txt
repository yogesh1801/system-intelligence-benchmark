You are an expert in formal verification in TLA+. Given the variables and constants in `{spec_file}` and `{spec_cfg}`, produce a refinement mapping that defines the variables in `{spec_file}` in terms of the constants and variables in `{spec_validate_file}`.

This example illustrates the desired outcome (ILLUSTRATION ONLY, DO NOT USE THE NAMES HERE).

Specification (the variables on the left of `<-`):
```tla
---- MODULE Example ----

CONSTANT x

VARIABLE y, z

Init ==
    /\ y = 1
    /\ z = 2

Next ==
    \/ /\ y' \in {{1, x}}
       /\ UNCHANGED z
    \/ /\ z' \in {{3, 4}}
       /\ UNCHANGED y

====
```

Config file (in context of specification above):
```tla
INIT Init
NEXT Next
CONSTANT x = 42
```

Given the following definitions to match (right-hand side of `<-`):
```tla
CONSTANT maybe_x
VARIABLE yy, z
```

The resulting refinement would look like:
```tla
WITH
x <- maybe_x,
yy <- y
\* z is not renamed
```

Remember, THIS WAS JUST AN EXAMPLE. The real data follows.

Return ONLY pure TLA+ specification code - no markdown code blocks (no ```tla or ```). Do not include any explanations, comments, or formatting markers.

Specification `{spec_file}`:
```tla
{spec_file_contents}
```

`{spec_cfg}`:
```tla
{spec_cfg_contents}
```

`{spec_validate_file}` variables and constants to refine (right-hand side of `<-`):
```tla
{spec_validate_file_contents}
```
