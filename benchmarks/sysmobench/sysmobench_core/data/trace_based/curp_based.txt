* Each log represents one distributed execution with events from multiple nodes.
* Each trace log is stored in TSV format.

Top-Level fields:

1. **`event`**

   * String.
   * Describes the type of event (e.g., `"LeaderChange"`, `"Propose"`, `"ProcessProposeLeader"`, `"ProcessProposeNonLeader"`).

2. **`leader`**

   * List of operation objects.
   * Each object has:

     * `op`: always `"Update"`.
     * `path`: always an empty list (`[]`).
     * `args`: list with one element, typically a leader identifier string (e.g., `"r4"`, `"r5"`).

3. **`committedCommands`**

   * List of operation objects.
   * Each object has:

     * `op`: always `"Update"`.
     * `path`: always an empty list.
     * `args`: list containing a single element, which is always an empty list (`[]`).

4. **`speculativePool`**

   * List of operation objects.
   * Each object has:

     * `op`: always `"Update"`.
     * `path`: always an empty list.
     * `args`: list with one element: a dictionary mapping replica identifiers (`r1`, `r2`, …) to lists of keys (strings).
     * Keys may be empty lists (`[]`) or contain items such as `"key_0"`.

5. **`uncommittedPool`**

   * List of operation objects.
   * Same structure as `committedCommands`.
   * `args` always contains a single empty list.
