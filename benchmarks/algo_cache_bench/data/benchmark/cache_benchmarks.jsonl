{"id": "cache_benchmark_0", "sys_prompt": "Your task is to implement a cache replacement policy in Python. You can only reference the attributes provided below. You have read-only access to these attributes and no access to any functions.\n[Begin of accessible attributes]\nAn \"object\" represents the unit of a request, such as inserting an object into the cache or retrieving an object from the cache. Each object `obj` provides the following **read-only** attributes that you can reference:\n- `obj.key` (str): A string that uniquely identifies the object.\n- `obj.size` (int): A positive integer representing the size of the object in bytes.\n\nYou can also reference the following **read-only** attributes provided by a cache snapshots `cache_snapshot`:\n- `cache_snapshot.cache` (dict): A dictionary containing the cached objects, where the keys are the objects' keys, and the values are the corresponding objects themselves.\n- `cache_snapshot.size` (int): A non-negative integer representing the current total size of the cache in bytes.\n- `cache_snapshot.capacity` (int): A positive integer representing the maximum allowed size of the cache in bytes.\n- `cache_snapshot.access_count` (int): The current total number of cache accesses. You can also use this to represent current time.\n- `cache_snapshot.hit_count` (int): The current total number of cache hits.\n- `cache_snapshot.miss_count` (int): The current total number of cache misses.\n[End of accessible attributes]\n\nImplement your policy using the Python code framework below. Your implementation must strictly follow the comments in this Python code framework.\n[Begin of Python code framework]\n```python\n# Import anything you need below\n\n# Put tunable constant parameters below\n\n# Put the metadata specifically maintained by the policy below. \n\ndef evict(cache_snapshot, obj):\n    '''\n    This function defines how the policy chooses the eviction victim.\n    - Args:\n        - `cache_snapshot`: A snapshot of the current cache state.\n        - `obj`: The new object that needs to be inserted into the cache.\n    - Return:\n        - `candid_obj_key`: The key of the cached object that will be evicted to make room for `obj`.\n    '''\n    candid_obj_key = None\n    # Your code below\n    \n    return candid_obj_key\n\ndef update_after_hit(cache_snapshot, obj):\n    '''\n    This function defines how the policy update the metadata it maintains immediately after a cache hit.\n    - Args:\n        - `cache_snapshot`: A snapshot of the current cache state.\n        - `obj`: The object accessed during the cache hit.\n    - Return: `None`\n    '''\n    # Your code below\n\ndef update_after_insert(cache_snapshot, obj):\n    '''\n    This function defines how the policy updates the metadata it maintains immediately after inserting a new object into the cache.\n    - Args:\n        - `cache_snapshot`: A snapshot of the current cache state.\n        - `obj`: The object that was just inserted into the cache.\n    - Return: `None`\n    '''\n    # Your code below\n\ndef update_after_evict(cache_snapshot, obj, evicted_obj):\n    '''\n    This function defines how the policy updates the metadata it maintains immediately after evicting the victim.\n    - Args:\n        - `cache_snapshot`: A snapshot of the current cache state.\n        - `obj`: The object to be inserted into the cache.\n        - `evicted_obj`: The object that was just evicted from the cache.\n    - Return: `None`\n    '''\n    # Your code below\n```\n[End of code framework]\n\nYou **must not** alter the provided code framework. Also, keep the two comments \"# Put tunable constant parameters below\" and \"# Put the metadata specifically maintained by the policy below\" unchanged.", "user_prompt": "", "response": "", "metadata": {"scenario": "system_algorithm_design", "task": "cache_algorithm"}}
